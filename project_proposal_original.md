| Tech Stack | What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course.                               | Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, WTForms, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Render                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Type       | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Website                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

For logged in users it will also allow custom game lists to be made (things like "already played" or "want to play"), and allow users to leave ratings and reviews for the games they have played. Users can also follow other users that play similar games or that have left reviews indicating similar taste in games. |
| Users      | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The intended demographic is people who play video games and enjoy leaving reviews or researching new games to play based on other people's reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. | The RAWG video games database API should have all the functionality and data necessary to populate this site. https://rawg.io/apidocs ; User data for my database will be collected on registration (username/password) and through use of features in the site (making game lists, rating & reviewing games, following users).                                                                                                             |

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later.

## Labeling - Tag Legend

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Tag                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficulties will be essential.                                                                                                                                | Easy, Medium, Hard                                   |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack, Documentation, Feature |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Nice to Have, Stretch Goal                |
