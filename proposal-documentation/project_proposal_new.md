| Tech Stack         | What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course.                               | Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, WTForms, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Render                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Background Problem | What problem will your project be designed to fix?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The popular video game mod hosting website Nexus Mods ([nexusmods.com](https://nexusmods.com)) lacks a good way to bookmark or otherwise organize non-downloaded mods as you browse for interesting new mods. It has a 'Collections' feature that can group and publish your mod collection as a pre-made build list, but you need to download mods before they can be added. There is also a 'tracking' feature that is intended to notify users when mods they've downloaded and are using get new updates. But since it is not the intended purpose of the tracking feature, the filtering and organization on the tracking page has very poor sorting capabilities and no way to group mods or organize them to make finding the one you want easy.                                                                                                                                           |
| Goal               | What is the concept for your project that will alleviate the above problem?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | My goal is to create a website to provide mod bookmarking and organization functionality currently unavailable to the video game modding community using Nexus for non-downloaded mods. <br/>The tracking feature on Nexus can allow users to keep tabs on mods they want to bookmark with a single click, and will automatically import to their 'Nexus Tracking' mod list on the capstone site when they log in. From there users can add or move those mods to any number of custom lists they make to plan new builds, or just group mods however they want to organize them. Users can also follow other users to see what new lists they're building or which mods they're adding to their lists. Individual lists can also be followed.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Users              | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The intended demographic is PC gamers who use the Nexus Mods website to find and download modification packages for their games. Specifically, people who want to keep track of mods they're not committed to downloading right now, but think are interesting enough to bookmark for later and don't want to lose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Data               | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. | If I end up needing base game data, the RAWG video games database API ([rawg.io/apidocs](https://rawg.io/apidocs)) should have all the functionality and data necessary.<br/><br/>For game mod data and connection to Nexus Mods current user data, I'll use Nexus Mods' API ([Nexus API docs](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NexusMods/nexus-mods_public_api_params_in_form_data/1.0#/)). I will need to save at least some minimal mod data from Nexus to my database so other user-generated data and saved mod lists will correspond to real mods on Nexus.<br/><br/>User data for my database will be collected on registration (username/email/password) and through use of features in the site (making mod lists, adding required and/or conflicting mod info, following other users or their lists to see what mods are being bookmarked by friends or users with similar tastes). |

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later.

## Labeling - Tag Legend

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Tag                                                  |

| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficulties will be essential.                                                                                                                                | Easy, Medium, Hard                                   |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack, Documentation, Feature |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Nice to Have, Stretch Goal                |
